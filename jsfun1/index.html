Your tasks: 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. 
Test data: ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
